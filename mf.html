				<p style="width: 75%; text-align: left;">
					I participated in a Co-op at Micro Focus as a systems software engineer working on the Veritca Anaylics
					Platform team. The Vertica Analytics Platform is a multinode database which is used by many technology
					companies. I worked on two large projects during my time at Micro Focus, the projects are detailed below.

				<p style="width: 75%; text-align: left;">
					Containerized environments allow the user to deploy their system from any machine using memory storage in a
					hosted machine. I was tasked with turning the Vertica database into a docker image and then orchastrating a
					multinode containerized database through Kubernetes. This project was extremely interesting for me as I had
					never worked with Docker or Kubernetes before and over the course of 3 months I was able to learn a lot and
					create a viable product that is used by Vertica clients still today. The hardest part of the project was the
					Kubernetes orchestration as since the Vertica database is already multinoded there was a lot of work that
					needed to be done in manipulating the IP-addresses of nodes that were dieing and being recreated. Below is an
					image of how the
					containerized environment I created is orchastrated.

				<h2 style="width: 75%; text-align: left; color: #276bdc;">Geospatial Library Update</h2>
				<p style="width: 75%; text-align: left;">
					Geospatial libraries allow computing systems to work with and understand different types of geometries. When
					starting my project the Vertica database ran with GEOS-2.8.1 which was released in 2015. I was tasked with
					upgrading the database to work with GEOS-3.8.1, the most recent version during the time of my Co-op. This
					project involved a lot of C programming which I really enjoyed as it gave me the opportunity to improve my
					low-level programming skills.
