                <h2>COVID-19 CHANGES</h2>
                <p>Due to COVID-19, the Nashua schools are currently fully remote. However, we did not want this to
                    prevent students from extending their STEM experiences and stop them from bonding with our high
                    school volunteers. So, we are currently holding Zoom sessions for one hour a week for all students
                    that are a part of Ashok Arun. During this time, Ashok Arun students are using Scratch, and
                    developing
                    projects of their own. Scratch is a great introduction to coding. We believe that learning to code
                    instills great analytical thinking and problem solving skills in students. Students are getting 1 on
                    1 attention to connect with a high school mentor and design their own Scratch projects. All Ashok
                    Arun
                    volunteers are well versed in Scratch to help students develop a project of their imaginations.</p>
