					During the summer of 2022 I interned at Amazon Web Services as a Software development Engineer focused in
					machine learning. I was assigned to the client services team which focused on creating the search machine
					learning models for the RePost website. I was asked to improve the current machine learning models through
					data manipulation. I did this in a 3 step process which focused on noise reduction of the data, merging two
					different data sets, and developing an efficient splitting algorithm for the models. These data changes
					improved the models performance by over 8 percent. Below is a slide show that explains deeper all my steps and
					results.

						<h2>Homework Help</h2>
						<p>
							Nithya is currently a senior at Nashua High School South. Nithya has been fascinated by STEM since she was
							little. Her favorite subjects are math and computer science, but science is definitely a close second.
							Nithya loves that STEM requires creativity and logic, but is also very structured. With STEM, things that
							you could only ever imagine in your minds can be created. Through Ashok Arun, Nithya hopes to share her
							joy
							in STEM with students in hopes to inspire them. Outside of academics, Nithya enjoys dancing, playing
							piano, playing tennis, and binge watching <em>FRIENDS</em>.

							Nitya is currently a senior at Nashua High School North. She is passionate about computer science and
							math, and loves sharing her interest in STEM with others. Nitya believes that it is important for students
							to enjoy learning, so that they are more willing and able to absorb new concepts and skills. She hopes
							that Ashok Arun will give students the opportunity to develop an enthusiasm for STEM subjects at a young
							age, like she was able to. In her free time, Nitya enjoys playing the violin and spending time outdoors.
