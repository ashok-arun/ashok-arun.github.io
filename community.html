				<p style="width: 75%; text-align: left;">
					In my home town of Nashua, NH there are 11 elementary schools of which 7 are classified as Tier-1. Tier-1
					schools mean that atleast 80% of the students in the school are on a reduced meal plan. I noticed that
					students from lower income families don’t have the same opportunities that other students benefit from and
					lack proper academic support outside of the classroom. As a result, they fall behind and ultimately give up on
					school. My solution was to have high school volunteers work with students for two hours, once a week. The
					ratio of students to volunteers is about three to one. Students recieve help on homework, and then do a fun
					STEM activity that develops their STEM interest.

						<h2>Homework Help</h2>
						<p>
							During each STEMBuds session we spend 1 hour helping the students finish their school homework. We find
							this extremely important in our process as this allows the students to go home with no homework left and
							allows them to be done with school once home. This is important as it separates school for the rest of the
							students days and doesn't leave the burden of getting homework done on them or their families. During the
							1 hour session with the high school voluteer we are able to get multiple days of homework done with the
							students and make sure they are understanding their assignments. We were suprised by how excited the
							students were to get their homework done with us!

						<h2>STEM Activities</h2>
						<p>
							During the second hour of our sessions we do a fun STEM related activity with our students. I created all
							the activities and they are funded through fund raisers that I have run. The picture shows the students
							participating in an egg drop experiment. We also do experiments like creating volcanos and making slim.
							When the whether premites we bring the students outside and play different sports with them while also
							involving math questions into the games.

						<h2>COVID Programming</h2>
						<p>
							Due to COVID-19, the Nashua schools were fully remote. However, I did not want this to prevent
							students from extending their STEM experiences and stop them from bonding with the high school volunteers.
							STEMBuds held Zoom sessions for one hour a week, during this time students used Scratch programming.
							Scratch is a great introduction to coding. I believe that learning to code instills great analytical
							thinking and problem solving skills in students. Students are getting 1 on 1 attention to connect with a
							high school mentor and design their own Scratch projects.
